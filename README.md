# Project_Chocolate_Sales_Analysis_Using_Power_BI
About Developed an insightful Chocolate Sales dashboard using Power BI to provide insights to the Sales Team.

## Objective:
The objective of this project is to comprehensively analyse the raw data and provide actionable insights through a dashboard for improving total sales of a chocolate shop.These  insights will prove helpful for the sales team for their further analysis.
Throughout this project, I've had the chance to:<br />
  1.Dive deep into Pizza Sales data to uncover valuable insights. <br />
  2.Develop interactive dashboards to visualise key HR metrics.<br />
  3.Provide data-driven recommendations for strategic decision-making.

## Steps Followed:
### 1. Data Gathering:
Importing raw data .csv file into Power BI & transform to Power Query editor for cleaning and data processing.
### 2. Data cleaning:
Cleaning is done by removing empty columns, removing duplicates, errors etc.
Replacing values in column with proper values and naming.
Detecting data type of every column, using the auto detect data type function in Power query editor and performing manual cross check.
### 3. Data processing:
In the Power Query editor, a new table called "Measure Table" was created  by using the DAX expression.Further new measures were created under this table such as Change in sales, Season Sales, Total Quantity Sold and Total Sales
 In DAX Query view, new Table called as ‚ÄúCalendar dimension‚Äù is added along with various new columns like Month, Month Number, Quarter, Year etc for time Intelligence Functions
### 4. Data Modelling:
 In Model View,One to Many relationships were established between dimension tables and fact tables. For this Star Schema is used.
### 5. Data analysis:
Analysis involves the creation of a range of visual representations, including bar charts, key performance indicators (KPIs), table charts, pie charts, and other relevant visualisations.
These tools are utilised to gain insights and present data in a comprehensive and easily understandable manner.
